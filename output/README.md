### This directory contains output videos generated by the app.

They will be named respectively 1.mp4, 2.mp4, etc.

For more info on how to generate videos, visit [input/README.md](). If you'll encounter any problems, feel free to open a issue on GitHub!

This file should be deleted before generating videos (output directory always has to be empty).
