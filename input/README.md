### This folder contains files that are used for video generation.

The script will look for three files:
1. audio
2. image
3. video

Audio is expected to be an audio file, image an image, and video a video.

The code was tested using these file formats:
- audio - mp3 
- image - jpeg 
- video - mp4

However, ffmpeg shouldn't have any problems with other extensions :)
